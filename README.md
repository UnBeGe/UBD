Hello everyone!
This project is made by three friends in their spare time. Its a top-down pvp arena.
It uses a dedicated server. Server manager, rest gameserver and auth server is not present there (but nothing realy special they are just 3 c# mvp servers that anyone can easily write on his own). The game communicates with other services using HTTP JSON requests.
5.3.2 UE version is used.
